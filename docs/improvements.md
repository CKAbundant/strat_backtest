# strat_backtest Improvement Recommendations

This document outlines actionable improvements to enhance the strat_backtest library for better usability, maintainability, and adoption by Python developers building backtesting trading strategies.

## üéØ High Priority Improvements

### Package Structure & API Design
- [ ] **Create a simplified public API** - Currently requires importing from deep module paths. Create high-level imports in `__init__.py` to expose commonly used classes like `TradingStrategy`, configuration classes, and concrete implementations
- [ ] **Add factory methods** - Implement factory classes or methods for creating common strategy configurations (e.g., `create_long_only_strategy()`, `create_momentum_strategy()`)
- [ ] **Standardize naming conventions** - Some inconsistencies exist (e.g., `GenTrades` vs `GetTrades` in docstring at line 27 of `trade_strategy.py`)

### Documentation & Examples
- [ ] **Add comprehensive API documentation** - Generate Sphinx documentation with detailed API reference
- [ ] **Create getting started tutorial** - Step-by-step guide showing how to build a simple strategy from scratch
- [ ] **Add concrete implementation examples** - Provide working examples of `EntrySignal`, `ExitSignal`, and `GenTrades` implementations
- [ ] **Create example strategies repository** - Include common trading strategies (RSI, moving average crossover, momentum) as reference implementations

### Test Coverage & Quality
- [ ] **Increase test coverage from 87% to >95%** - Focus on untested areas:
  - `trade_strategy.py` (0% coverage - critical!)
  - `base/trade_signal.py` (48% coverage)
  - `utils/file_utils.py` (28% coverage)
  - `utils/dataframe_utils.py` (56% coverage)
  - `utils/time_utils.py` (54% coverage)
- [ ] **Add integration tests** - Test complete strategy workflows end-to-end
- [ ] **Add performance benchmarks** - Create tests to ensure backtesting performance doesn't degrade

### Error Handling & Validation
- [ ] **Improve error messages** - Make validation errors more descriptive and actionable
- [ ] **Add input validation** - Validate DataFrame schemas, required columns, and data types at strategy entry points
- [ ] **Add data quality checks** - Detect and handle common data issues (gaps, duplicates, invalid values)
- [ ] **Implement graceful degradation** - Handle missing optional dependencies or features

## üöÄ Medium Priority Improvements

### Performance & Scalability
- [ ] **Add vectorized operations** - Replace loops with pandas/numpy vectorized operations where possible
- [ ] **Implement parallel processing** - Add multiprocessing support for backtesting multiple assets
- [ ] **Add memory optimization** - Implement data chunking for large datasets
- [ ] **Create performance profiling tools** - Built-in timing and memory usage reporting

### Developer Experience
- [ ] **Add type checking with mypy** - Configure mypy and fix type annotation issues
- [ ] **Improve IDE support** - Better docstring formatting for IntelliSense/autocomplete
- [ ] **Add pre-commit hooks** - Automate code formatting, linting, and basic tests
- [ ] **Create development container** - Docker setup for consistent development environment

### Features & Functionality
- [ ] **Add data source integrations** - Built-in connectors for common data providers (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage)
- [ ] **Implement strategy composition** - Allow combining multiple strategies
- [ ] **Add portfolio-level backtesting** - Support for multi-asset portfolios with position sizing
- [ ] **Create visualization utilities** - Built-in plotting for equity curves, drawdowns, and performance metrics

### Configuration & Flexibility
- [ ] **Add configuration validation** - Validate strategy configurations at initialization
- [ ] **Support for custom metrics** - Plugin system for custom performance metrics
- [ ] **Add strategy serialization** - Save/load strategy configurations to/from JSON/YAML
- [ ] **Implement parameter optimization** - Built-in grid search and optimization tools

## üîß Low Priority Improvements

### Code Organization
- [ ] **Refactor large classes** - Break down complex classes (e.g., `GenTrades` with 189 statements)
- [ ] **Create plugin architecture** - Make components more modular and extensible
- [ ] **Add abstract base tests** - Reduce test code duplication with base test classes
- [ ] **Organize utility functions** - Group related utilities into logical modules

### Compatibility & Standards
- [ ] **Add Python 3.12+ support** - Test and ensure compatibility with latest Python versions
- [ ] **Follow PEP 8 more strictly** - Additional style improvements beyond current 10/10 pylint score
- [ ] **Add semantic versioning** - Implement proper version management with changelog
- [ ] **Create migration guides** - Document breaking changes and upgrade paths

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] **Add logging framework** - Structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- [ ] **Implement progress reporting** - Progress bars for long-running backtests
- [ ] **Add memory usage tracking** - Monitor and report memory consumption during backtests
- [ ] **Create debugging utilities** - Tools for inspecting strategy state and intermediate results

## üìä Current Status Summary

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Excellent pylint score (10/10) 
- ‚úÖ Good test coverage (87%)
- ‚úÖ Modern Python features (type hints, dataclasses)
- ‚úÖ Proper package structure with UV dependency management
- ‚úÖ Well-defined abstract base classes

**Areas Needing Attention:**
- ‚ùå `TradingStrategy` class has 0% test coverage
- ‚ùå Missing comprehensive documentation
- ‚ùå No concrete implementation examples
- ‚ùå Complex API requiring deep imports
- ‚ùå Limited error handling and validation

## üéØ Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Fix critical test coverage gaps** (especially `trade_strategy.py`)
2. **Create comprehensive documentation with examples**
3. **Simplify public API with high-level imports**
4. **Add concrete strategy implementations as examples**
5. **Implement better error handling and validation**
6. **Add performance optimizations and monitoring**

## üìà Success Metrics

- [ ] Test coverage ‚â• 95%
- [ ] Complete API documentation with examples
- [ ] At least 3 working strategy examples
- [ ] Installation and first-strategy tutorial taking < 30 minutes
- [ ] Zero-import public API (import from package root)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for common use cases
